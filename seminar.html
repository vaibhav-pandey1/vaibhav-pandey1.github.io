    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Aryaman Maithani (Utah) <br />
    <strong>Title: </strong> Polynomial invariants of GL₂: Conjugation over finite fields <br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Consider the conjugation action of GL₂(K) on the polynomial ring K[X₂ₓ₂]. 
When K is an infinite field, the ring of invariants is a polynomial ring generated by the trace and the determinant. 
We describe the ring of invariants when K is a finite field, and show that it is a hypersurface.

    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Vignesh Jagathese (UIC)<br />
    <strong>Title:</strong> Quasi-F-Purity and F-pure Thresholds<br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> A weakening of Frobenius splitting, Quasi-F-Splittings have proven to be a vital invariant in the study of varieties in positive characteristic, 
    with numerous applications to birational geometry and singularities. In this talk I'll provide an overview of Quasi-F-Splittings and introduce a local analogue, Quasi-F-Purity, 
    and discuss its various permanence properties. I will also discuss how quasi-F-pure hypersurfaces are "as close to being F-pure as possible" by computing the F-pure Threshold of an arbitrary quasi-F-pure hypersurface. 
    This talk includes joint work with JJ Garzella.

    <strong>Title:</strong> The arithmetic rank of residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal<br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The arithmetic rank of a variety is the minimal number of equations needed to define it set-theoretically, i.e., the smallest number of polynomials generating the defining ideal upto radical. Computing this invariant is notoriously difficult: the minimal generators up to radical often bear little relation to the given ideal generators and can vary unpredictably across characteristics. 

<p>Residual intersections provide a natural extension of the classical notion of algebraic links. We establish a general upper bound for the arithmetic rank of any residual intersection of a complete intersection ideal in an arbitrary Noetherian ring, and we show that this bound is sharp under specific characteristic assumptions. This work is joint with Kesavan Mohana Sundaram, Taylor Murray, and Vaibhav Pandey.<p />

    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Reinold Huebl (Regensburg)<br />
    <strong>Title:</strong> Parametrization of algebroid Curve Singularities<br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk is based on joint work with C. Huneke, S. Maitra, and V. Mukundan. 

  <p>A reduced and irreducible one-dimensional local complete domain <i>R</i> over an algebraically closed field <i>k</i> can be parametrized in many different ways as a subring of its integral closure <i>R</i> = k[[t]]. In this talk we will show that there is a unique sequence of positive integers 
  a<sub>1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; a<sub>n</sub> 
  such that any set x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> in <i>R</i> with valuations v<sub>R</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>) = a<sub>i</sub> defines a minimal parametrization of <i>R</i>. We will then use this result to study the torsion of differential forms and to prove a theorem about modifications of parametrizations of <i>R</i>.</p>

    <strong>Title:</strong> On the ideals of cyclic Gaussian graphical models <br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  In this talk, we introduce a conjecture due to Sturmfels and Uhler concerning generation of the prime ideal of the variety associated to the Gaussian graphical model of any cycle graph and explain how to prove it using commutative algebra and combinatorics. Our methods are also applicable to a large class of ideals with radical initial ideals. This work is done jointly with A. Conner and M. Michalek.

    <strong>Wednesday, October 15 </strong><br /><br />
    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Joel Castillo Rey (BCAM, Basque)<br />
    <strong>Title:</strong> The Strong Watanabe–Yoshida conjecture for complete intersections.<br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  The Watanabe–Yoshida conjecture states that the Hilbert–Kunz multiplicity attains its minimal value across singularities exactly at quadric hypersurfaces. It further claims that these are characterised by this property, but this part of the conjecture remained largely unaddressed in the literature.
<p> We present an affirmative answer to this problem for complete intersections in every positive characteristic, improving a theorem by Enescu and Shimomoto, thus settling the conjecture for this family of singularities. The proof relies on advanced characteristic-dependent applications of a technique developed by Han and Monsky, and critically includes a explicit calculation needed to fill the gaps for the often-overlooked characteristic 2 case.</p>

    <strong>Wednesday, October 22 </strong><br /><br />
    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Dan Bath (KU Leuven)<br />
    <strong>Title:</strong> he strong monodromy conjecture and certain projective plane curves <br />
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  I will discuss ongoing work with Wim Veys on the "next open case" of the Strong Monodromy Conjecture. I will tell you what the Strong Monodromy Conjecture is, what the next open case is, and how, in this (and in some more general, but similar settings) to completely "solve" the D-module part of the story. I will coyly hint at what can (and is being done) on the zeta function side. Provocative pictures will be drawn.
