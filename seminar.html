        <strong>Speaker:</strong> Reinhold Huebl (Resensburg)<br />
        <strong>Title:</strong> Equivalence of curve singulariies and &delta;-invariants<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk is about joint work with I. Swanson.
A longstanding question in algebraic geometry is the classification of reduced and
irreducible local complete one-dimensional domains <em>R</em> over an algebraically closed
field <em>k</em>. It is known that such a ring is completely determined once it is known up
to a &ldquo;sufficiently high&rdquo; power of its maximal ideal, where this sufficiently
high power depends on the singularity degree &delta; of the ring.
</p>

<p>
In this talk we show that two parametrizations of curves parametrize isomorphic
curve singularities if they agree up to degree 2&delta; + 2, strengthening a result of
Greuel and Pfister, and that two curve singularities are already isomorphic if they
are isomorphic mod <em>m</em><sup>2&delta; + 2</sup>, strengthening a result of Hironaka.

        <strong>Speaker:</strong> Manav Batavia (Purdue)<br />
        <strong>Title:</strong>  A sharp upper bound on cohomological dimension in mixed characteristic <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Given an ideal I in a regular local ring A, the cohomological dimension
of I in A is the index of the highest non-vanishing local cohomology of A supported at I.
Determining effective upper bounds on the cohomological dimension in terms of topological invariants of Spec(A/I)
is a central problem in commutative algebra: foundational results include the
Hartshorne--Lichtenbaum Vanishing Theorem and the Second Vanishing Theorem.  </p>

<p> In equal characteristic, Faltings established in 1980 a general bound on the cohomological dimension of an ideal
in terms of its “big height”. In this talk, we extend Faltings’ results to the unramified
mixed characteristic setting and show that the resulting bound is sharp.</p>

        <strong>Speaker:</strong> Kangjin Han (DGIST, Korea)<br />
        <strong>Title:</strong> Singular loci and defining ideals of higher secant varieties of some Veronese embeddings<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
    Secant construction is one of the main methods to build a new geometric object
    from a given one in algebraic geometry. Recently, higher secant varieties of
    Veronese and Segre embeddings draw strong attention in the context of tensor
    rank and decomposition. In this talk, we first recall some general facts and
    questions on higher secant varieties, briefly review known results on the topic,
    and then focus on some problems on singularity of secants and finding defining
    equations and ideals.

  <p>
    For this, we also introduce some key notions, which are <q>subsecant locus</q>,
    <q><span class="math">k</span>-secant variety of minimal degree</q> and
    <q>del Pezzo <span class="math">k</span>-secant variety</q>. Next, we focus on
    the case of
    <span class="math">
      σ<sub>4</sub>(v<sub>3</sub>(ℙ<sup>3</sup>))
    </span> in
    <span class="math">ℙ<sup>19</sup></span> as explaining our method and
    considering its consequences. This talk is based on joint works with
    K. Furukawa (Josai Univ).</p>

        <strong>Title: </strong> Polynomial invariants of GL₂: Conjugation over finite fields <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Consider the conjugation action of GL₂(K) on the polynomial ring K[X₂ₓ₂].
        When K is an infinite field, the ring of invariants is a polynomial ring generated by the trace and the determinant.
        We describe the ring of invariants when K is a finite field, and show that it is a hypersurface.

        <strong>Title:</strong> Quasi-F-Purity and F-pure Thresholds<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> A weakening of Frobenius splitting, Quasi-F-Splittings have proven to be a vital invariant
        in the study of varieties in positive characteristic, with numerous applications to birational geometry and
        singularities. In this talk I'll provide an overview of Quasi-F-Splittings and introduce a local analogue,
        Quasi-F-Purity, and discuss its various permanence properties. I will also discuss how quasi-F-pure hypersurfaces
        are "as close to being F-pure as possible" by computing the F-pure Threshold of an arbitrary quasi-F-pure
        hypersurface. This talk includes joint work with JJ Garzella.

        <strong>Speaker:</strong> Manav Batavia (Purdue)<br />
        <strong>Title:</strong> The arithmetic rank of residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The arithmetic rank of a variety is the minimal number of equations needed to define it
        set-theoretically, i.e., the smallest number of polynomials generating the defining ideal upto radical. Computing
        this invariant is notoriously difficult: the minimal generators up to radical often bear little relation to the
        given ideal generators and can vary unpredictably across characteristics.
        <p>
          Residual intersections provide a natural extension of the classical notion of algebraic links. We establish a
          general upper bound for the arithmetic rank of any residual intersection of a complete intersection ideal in an
          arbitrary Noetherian ring, and we show that this bound is sharp under specific characteristic assumptions. This
          work is joint with Kesavan Mohana Sundaram, Taylor Murray, and Vaibhav Pandey.

        <strong>Speaker:</strong> Reinold Huebl (Regensburg)<br />
        <strong>Title:</strong> Parametrization of algebroid Curve Singularities<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk is based on joint work with C. Huneke, S. Maitra, and V. Mukundan.
        <p>
          A reduced and irreducible one-dimensional local complete domain <i>R</i> over an algebraically closed field
          <i>k</i> can be parametrized in many different ways as a subring of its integral closure
          <i>R</i> = k[[t]]. In this talk we will show that there is a unique sequence of positive integers
          a<sub>1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; a<sub>n</sub> such that any set x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> in <i>R</i>
          with valuations v<sub>R</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>) = a<sub>i</sub> defines a minimal parametrization of <i>R</i>.
          We will then use this result to study the torsion of differential forms and to prove a theorem about
          modifications of parametrizations of <i>R</i>.

        <strong>Title:</strong> On the ideals of cyclic Gaussian graphical models <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we introduce a conjecture due to Sturmfels and Uhler concerning generation
        of the prime ideal of the variety associated to the Gaussian graphical model of any cycle graph and explain how
        to prove it using commutative algebra and combinatorics. Our methods are also applicable to a large class of
        ideals with radical initial ideals. This work is done jointly with A. Conner and M. Michalek.

        <strong>Title:</strong> The Strong Watanabe–Yoshida conjecture for complete intersections.<br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Watanabe–Yoshida conjecture states that the Hilbert–Kunz multiplicity attains its
        minimal value across singularities exactly at quadric hypersurfaces. We present an affirmative answer for
        complete intersections in every positive characteristic, improving a theorem by Enescu and Shimomoto.

        <strong>Title:</strong> Fibered Sums of Affine Semigroups and Algebras <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Let S, S₁ and S₂ be affine semigroups with S embedded in S₁ and S₂ respectively. We
        introduce the fibered sum of two such affine semigroup algebras. This is joint work with I-Chiau Huang and
        Jung-Chen Liu.
